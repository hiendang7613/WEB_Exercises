				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>
				<p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
					recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
					like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to
					develop serious illness.</p>
				<p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
					disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands
					or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. </p>
				<p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
					infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for
					example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
				</p>
	
				<p>Stay informed:</p>
